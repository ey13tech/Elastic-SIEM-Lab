# Elastic SIEM Lab

The goal of my project was to independently set up and configure a robust security information and event management (SIEM) system using Elastic Stack on ARM architecture. My objective was to optimize log collection and transmission to the SIEM platform using Elastic Agents, while also refining my skills in security event analysis and threat detection. Additionally, I aimed to develop a custom dashboard within Elastic SIEM to visualize security events effectively and rigorously test alert rules for efficient threat response.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
