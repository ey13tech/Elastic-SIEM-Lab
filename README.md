# Elastic SIEM Lab

The goal of my project was to independently set up and configure a robust security information and event management (SIEM) system using Elastic Stack on ARM architecture. My objective was to optimize log collection and transmission to the SIEM platform using Elastic Agents, while also refining my skills in security event analysis and threat detection. Additionally, I aimed to develop a custom dashboard within Elastic SIEM to visualize security events effectively and rigorously test alert rules for efficient threat response.
